1- CSV to Natalia:
	get listing by id [merged get_listing() with get_location()]

	# done but we have probelm with no null response from API and no offeringType
	# exec again but dont forget mapping csv file





2- to lambda:

	to_lambd = [lead_raw, listing_by_id, agent_by_reference_nbr]
	# almost done (make mock api to send)
